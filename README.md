Any E-commerce application has many products which is categorized or grouped.

In this application, I have created a web service using Spring Boot technology so that we can access product based on category.
Following URL will help to access  the categories as well as products

http://localhost:8080/categories/ <br>
http://localhost:8080/categories/categoryId/ <br>
http://localhost:8080/categories/categoryId/products/ <br>
http://localhost:8080/categories/categoryId/products/productId/ <br>
